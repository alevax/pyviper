Whenever you incude a new functionality into pyviper please also:
1. check that the docstring can be appropriately rendered with Sphynx
2. if new dependencies are included, please update
   - pyproject.toml: under dependencies  
   - setup.py: under install_requires
   - docs/requirements.txt
3. if the new function has to be displayed in the documentation, include it into the corresponding module in docs/pyviper.rst 
4. You can test locally whether the documentation is appropriately rendered following: https://gamifyit-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-manuals/readthedocs/test-locally.html.
   The main steps after setting up the environment as described in the link, from the pyviper folder include running:
      cd docs
      pip install -r requirements.txt  
      make html             
      cd ..
